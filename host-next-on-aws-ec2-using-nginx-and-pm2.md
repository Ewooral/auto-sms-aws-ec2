Ewooral: hey

GitHub Copilot: Hello! How can I assist you with your programming needs today?

Ewooral: I am trying to host my next js app on aws ec2 instance using nginx. show me the step by step process. leave no step unturn

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to host your Next.js app on an AWS EC2 instance using Nginx.

1. **Create an AWS EC2 instance**
   - Log into your AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Click on "Launch Instance" and select your preferred OS (for example, Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS).
   - Choose an instance type (for example, t2.micro) and click "Next".
   - Configure instance details, add storage, add tags as per your requirements and click "Next".
   - Configure the security group to allow traffic on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS) and click "Review and Launch".
   - Review your instance and click "Launch". Select an existing key pair or create a new one, acknowledge that you have access to the selected private key file (.pem), and then click "Launch Instances".

2. **Connect to your EC2 instance**
   - From the EC2 Dashboard, select your instance and click "Connect".
   - Follow the instructions to connect to your instance using SSH.

3. **Update your EC2 instance**
   - Once connected, update the package lists for upgrades and new package installations:
     ```
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get upgrade
     ```

4. **Install Node.js and NPM**
   - Install Node.js and NPM using the following commands:
     ```
     curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
     sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
     ```

5. **Install Git**
   - Install Git using the following command:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install git
     ```

6. **Clone your Next.js app**
   - Clone your Next.js app from your repository:
     ```
     git clone <your-repository-url>
     ```

7. **Install your Next.js app dependencies**
   - Navigate to your app directory and install the dependencies:
     ```
     cd <your-app-directory>
     npm install
     ```

8. **Build your Next.js app**
   - Build your Next.js app using the following command:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```

9. **Install PM2**
   - PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications. Install it using the following command:
     ```
     sudo npm install -g pm2
     ```

10. **Start your Next.js app**
    - Start your Next.js app using PM2:
      ```
      pm2 start npm --name "<app-name>" -- start
      ```

11. **Install Nginx**
    - Install Nginx using the following command:
      ```
      sudo apt-get install nginx
      ```

12. **Configure Nginx**
    - Remove the default Nginx configuration file and create a new one:
      ```
      sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
      sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
      ```
    - Add the following configuration, replace `server_name` with your domain name or public IP address:
      ```
      server {
          listen 80;
          server_name <your-domain-name-or-ip>;
          location / {
              proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
              proxy_http_version 1.1;
              proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
              proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
              proxy_set_header Host $host;
              proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
          }
      }
      ```
    - Save and close the file.

13. **Restart Nginx**
    - Restart Nginx to apply the changes:
      ```
      sudo service nginx restart
      ```

14. **Open your app in a web browser**
    - Open a web browser and navigate to your domain name or public IP address.

Remember to replace `<your-repository-url>`, `<your-app-directory>`, `<app-name>`, and `<your-domain-name-or-ip>` with your actual repository URL, app directory, app name, and domain name or IP address respectively.

Ewooral: pm2 start npm --name "auto-sms --start did not work rather pm2 start pnpm - name "auto-sms" - start
 worked but app name was pnpm

GitHub Copilot: It seems like there was a misunderstanding in the command. The `pm2 start` command should be used with the script that starts your application. If you're using `pnpm` instead of `npm`, and your start script is named "start", the correct command would be:

```bash
pm2 start "pnpm run start" --name "auto-sms"
```

This command tells PM2 to start a process with "pnpm run start" (which should be the command to start your application), and names that process "auto-sms".

The reason you're seeing a process named "pnpm" is because the command you ran was telling PM2 to start a process with "pnpm", and the name of that process was "auto-sms". The `- start` at the end of your command was not recognized as a valid option, so it was ignored.

Try stopping the current processes and starting the "auto-sms" process again with the corrected command:

```bash
pm2 stop all
pm2 delete all
pm2 start "pnpm run start" --name "auto-sms"
```

This will stop all processes, remove them from PM2's process list, and then start your "auto-sms" application.

Ewooral: below is my package,json file of my next app. use it for the command above
{
  "name": "auto-sms",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18",
    "react-dom": "^18",
    "next": "14.2.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5",
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^18",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18",
    "postcss": "^8",


GitHub Copilot: Given your `package.json` file, the `start` script is `"next start"`, which starts the Next.js server. If you're using `pnpm`, you can start your application with `pnpm run start`.

So, the command to start your application with PM2 should be:

```bash
pm2 start "pnpm run start" --name "auto-sms"
```

This command tells PM2 to start a process with "pnpm run start" (which starts your Next.js server), and names that process "auto-sms".

If you want to ensure that PM2 will restart your application if it crashes, or if the server reboots, you can add the `--watch` and `--restart` flags:

```bash
pm2 start "pnpm run start" --name "auto-sms" --watch --restart
```

The `--watch` flag tells PM2 to watch for any changes in the application and restart the application if any changes are detected. The `--restart` flag tells PM2 to restart the application if it crashes.

Ewooral:  pm2 start "pnpm run start" --name "auto-sms" --watch --restart

  error: unknown option `--restart'


GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. The `--restart` flag is not a valid option for the `pm2 start` command. The `--watch` flag should be sufficient to restart the application when changes are detected.

Here's the corrected command:

```bash
pm2 start "pnpm run start" --name "auto-sms" --watch
```

This command will start your application and PM2 will restart it whenever changes are detected in the filesystem. 

If you want your application to automatically restart even after system reboot, you can use the PM2 startup script. Here's how you can do it:

1. Generate a startup script with PM2:

```bash
pm2 startup
```

2. This will output a command that you need to run. It will look something like this (it depends on your system):

```bash
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u ubuntu --hp /home/ubuntu
```

3. Run the command that was outputted.

4. Now save the current status of running apps, so that they can be resurrected after a system reboot:

```bash
pm2 save
```

Now, PM2 will restart your applications after a system reboot.
